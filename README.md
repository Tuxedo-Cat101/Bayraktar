This is a project where we take a Tello Drone, fly it through hulahoops and it detects the color of said hulahoop.

Team Members: Connor, Teagan, Logan(Logiebear)

Instructions: Turn on the drone, wait for a flashing yellow light on said drone, then connect your device to the drone.
              Running the code should automatically connect the drone, you should get two tabs to pop-up, the pygame and camera feed.
              The pygame tab must be selected to do controls
